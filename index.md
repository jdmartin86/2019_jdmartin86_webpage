I am a PhD student at [Stevens Institute of Technology](stevens.edu), working in the Robust Field Autonomy Laboratory with Prof. Brendan Englot. My research focuses on probabilistic models for safe decision making and learning for robotic systems. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned bachelors degrees in Physics and Aerospace Engineering.
