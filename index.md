I am a PhD student at [Stevens Institute of Technology](http://www.stevens.edu), working in the [Robust Field Autonomy Laboratory](http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/) with [Prof. Brendan Englot](https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=2043). My research focuses on probabilistic models for safe decision making and learning for robotic systems. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned bachelors degrees in Physics and Aerospace Engineering.
